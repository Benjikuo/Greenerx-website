# Greenerx-website
This website serves both as a university SDGs project showcasing sustainable design and technical implementation, and as the official platform for the GreenerX environmental campaign.

Note:
Cloudflare Pages fallback allows non-language-prefixed routes
(e.g. /calculator/) to resolve to index.html.
This is a known behavior and intentionally left as-is for MVP.
